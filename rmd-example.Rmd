# This is a header
This is *italic* and **bold** text.

```{r}
# This is code

a <- 1 + 1

a
```

You can use inline code: a = `r a`

You can also have [links](https://github.com/jdaas/DynamicExamples/), for example to the source code of this document on GitHub.

## This is a subheader

You can show math $\frac{a}{b}$ inline and as a block

$$ a \rightarrow b $$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# This code will be evaluated,

a <- 1:10
b <- 1:10

plot(x = a, y = b)
# but only the output will be shown
```
